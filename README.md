# Hi, I'm Jonathan 👋

I grew up loving mathematical proofs, spent time crafting transport policies, and now build AI/ML systems for healthcare. I spend a lot of time in cafés with good books and even better cakes.

## 🚀 What I Work On
- 🏥 I develop ML solutions at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, focusing on end-to-end systems from research to deployment.
- 🚇 Previously, I analyzed transit ticketing policies at LTA Singapore, where I learned to merge data with real-world impact.

## 🎯 Beyond Data & AI
- 📸 **Photography** – Capturing quiet corners of **Japan’s countryside** when I'm not coding.
- ☕ **Café Explorer** – Always on the lookout for great coffee and pastries (I love cinammon rolls).
- 🎵 **Music Enthusiast** – Attempting to learn **piano** (work in progress!).

I'm best reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyeomingjie/). Always open to interesting conversations about AIML, or café recommendations!
